# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection Function
This Python script provides a comprehensive function (detect_xss) for detecting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in a given web link. XSS is a common web application security issue that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed users. The function uses a combination of automated techniques and manual checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.

# How to Use

## 1. Dependencies
Make sure to install the required Python libraries using the following command:

```
pip install requests selenium
```
### Additionally, download the ChromeDriver executable and specify its correct path in the script.

## 2. Import Modules
```
import requests
import random
from urllib.parse import urljoin
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
```
## 4. Define User Agents (Optional)
You can define a list of user agents to be used in requests to make the detection process appear more like genuine user activity.

## 5. Copy detect_xss Function
Copy the detect_xss function from the provided script into your project.

## 6. Use the Function
Use the detect_xss function by passing a web link as an argument:
```
link = "https://example.com"
result = detect_xss(link)

if result:
    print("The link is vulnerable to XSS.")
else:
    print("No XSS vulnerability found.")
```
The function returns True if it detects an XSS vulnerability and False otherwise. During the detection process, relevant information will be printed.

## Advanced Usage
The script includes additional functions that can be used for more advanced scenarios:
### 1- manually_check_xss_visible: Launches a visible browser to manually check for XSS vulnerabilities.
### 2- manually_check_xss_hidden: Launches a hidden browser to manually check for XSS vulnerabilities.
### 3- manually_check_xss_inspect: Allows the user to inspect the page manually using a visible browser.
### 4- bypass_filter: Attempts to bypass filters applied to block XSS payloads.
### 5- generate_auto_payload: Generates a new payload based on encoding patterns and additional techniques.

## Note: Manual checks using a visible or hidden browser require the correct path to the ChromeDriver executable.


customize the script based on your specific requirements and the nature of the web application being tested. Always use this script responsibly and only on web applications that you are authorized to test for security vulnerabilities.
