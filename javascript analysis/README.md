## Summary:
The code is a Python script designed to analyze JavaScript files from specified URLs, extracting sensitive information using linguistic analysis and regular expressions. The code utilizes the requests, BeautifulSoup, spacy, and other Python libraries for web scraping, natural language processing, and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing.

## How It Works:
### Initialization:
The code starts by defining constants like cache size and expiration time.
Required libraries (requests, BeautifulSoup, spacy) are imported.
Page Content Retrieval:

1. The get_page_content function fetches the HTML content of a web page using an HTTP GET request.
JavaScript Links Extraction:

2. The extract_javascript_links function utilizes BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract JavaScript file links. JavaScript Files Analysis:

3. The analyze_javascript_files function processes each JavaScript file from the provided URLs. Utilizes spaCy for linguistic analysis and regular expressions for pattern matching to identify sensitive information.
AST Analysis:

4. The analyze_ast function analyzes the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of JavaScript code to extract sensitive information.
Function Calls Analysis:

5. The analyze_function_calls function identifies and records function calls, such as 'alert' or 'console.log'.
Main Analysis:

6. The main_analysis function orchestrates the analysis of JavaScript files and compiles a list of sensitive data.

Certainly! Here are the key features of the analyze_javascript_files function:

## Key Features:
1. Linguistic Analysis:
2. Error Handling:
3. Result Compilation:
4. Caching Mechanism:
5. Looping Through URLs:
6. Conditional Result Appending:
7. Flexibility for Future Expansion:

## How code works
Here is an example of how to use code:
```
website_urls = ["https://example1.com", "https://example2.com"]
javascript_links = [extract_javascript_links(url) for url in website_urls]

if javascript_links:
    print(f"Found JavaScript files on the websites.")

    # Analyze all JavaScript files
    result = main_analysis(javascript_links)

    if result:
        print("\nSensitive data found in the JavaScript files:")
        for data in result:
            print(data)
    else:
        print("No sensitive data found in the JavaScript files.")
```
In this example, it is used to extract JavaScript links from two websites. Then, it is used to analyze these links and identify any sensitive data.extract_javascript_links main_analysis()

If sensitive data is found, a list of them will be printed on the console. If no sensitive data is found, a message is printed on the console.

### Linguistic analysis
The library can be used to analyze the syntax of JavaScript code. This analysis can be used to identify entities such as names, organizations, and dates, which can be sensitive data. For example, the following code can be used to extract people's names from a JavaScript: spaCy file
```
def extract_names(javascript_code):
    for entity in spacy_nlp(javascript_code).ents:
        if entity.label == "PERSON":
            return entity.text
```
This code uses the library to create a list of entities from JavaScript code. The entities are then filtered to include only entities with a label. The text of each entity is then returned person.spaCyPERSON

### Installation of libraries:
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
pip install spacy
pip install regex
pip install ast
```
The provided code includes several functions for extracting and analyzing JavaScript files from web pages, searching for sensitive data patterns within these files. Below is an explanation of how you can use these functions in another program:
get_page_content(url) Function:
Purpose: Fetches the content of a web page given its URL.
How to Use:
```
url = "https://example.com"
page_content = get_page_content(url)
extract_javascript_links(url) Function:
```
Purpose: Extracts JavaScript links from the HTML content of a web page.
How to Use:
```
url = "https://example.com"
javascript_links = extract_javascript_links(url)
analyze_javascript_files(urls) Function:
```
Purpose: Analyzes JavaScript files for sensitive information based on linguistic analysis and predefined regex patterns.
How to Use:
```
website_urls = ["https://example1.com", "https://example2.com"]
result = analyze_javascript_files(website_urls)
Functions for Linguistic Analysis and Regex Patterns:
```
The  function internally calls functions for linguistic analysis using spaCy and regex pattern matching.analyze_javascript_files
main_analysis(urls) Function:
Purpose: Executes the main analysis for each URL and aggregates the results.
How to Use:
```
website_urls = ["https://example1.com", "https://example2.com"]
result = main_analysis(website_urls)
```
Example Usage:
The provided code includes an example at the end, where it fetches JavaScript links from a list of website URLs and performs the main analysis.

Additional Information:
Ensure you have the required libraries installed before using these functions in your program.
When using these functions in another program, you may want to handle exceptions appropriately, and you can customize the patterns used for sensitive data according to your specific requirements. The code can be extended or modified based on your use case and integration needs.
