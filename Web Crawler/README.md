# Overview
The provided code defines an asynchronous function that crawls a website and extracts links, taking into account various factors such as hidden links, embedded content, and anti-crawling mechanisms.
Function Breakdown

### crawl_website(url, parameter_name, batch_size=10):
This function takes three arguments:
url: The base URL of the website to crawl
parameter_name: The name of the parameter to add to extracted URLs
batch_size: The number of URLs to crawl in each batch (default: 10)
It returns a list of extracted links.

### visit_url(session, url):
This asynchronous function visits a given URL and extracts links from its HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
It checks for hidden links using the function and adds valid links to the set.is_hidden_link()extracted_links

### validate_link(session, url):
This asynchronous function validates a given URL by making a HEAD request and checking if the status code is 200.
It returns if the link is valid and otherwise.TrueFalse

### batch_crawl(session, batch):
This asynchronous function takes a list of URLs as a batch and creates asynchronous tasks for each URL using .visit_url()
It awaits the completion of all tasks using .asyncio.gather()

### analyze_embedded_content(session, url):
This asynchronous function analyzes a given URL to extract links from embedded images and videos using BeautifulSoup.
It combines the extracted links and calls to further process them.process_embedded_links()

### handle_anti_crawl(session, url):
This asynchronous function handles anti-crawling mechanisms by introducing a random delay and using a random user agent.
It makes a GET request to the URL and processes the response as needed.

### is_hidden_link(response_text, link):
This function checks if a given link is considered hidden based on specific patterns or keywords in the response text.
This function checks whether the specified link is considered hidden based on patterns or keywords specified in the response body.

### Note (You can add patterns or keywords to search through)
It returns if the link is hidden and otherwise.TrueFalse

### get_random_user_agent():
This function returns a random user agent from a list of predefined user agents.

### main():
This asynchronous function defines the main execution flow.
It calls with the specified URL and parameter name to extract links.crawl_website()
It prints the extracted links to the console.

### asyncio.run(main()):
This line runs the asynchronous function using the event loop.main()asyncio.run()
Key Points

The code utilizes asynchronous programming with to efficiently handle multiple requests concurrently.aiohttp
It employs techniques to deal with hidden links, embedded content, and anti-crawling mechanisms.
It demonstrates the use of for HTML parsing and link extraction.BeautifulSoup
It showcases the use of random user agents to mimic human-like behavior.

## Notes
The code demonstrates a general approach to crawling a website and extracting links. The specific logic for handling anti-crawling mechanisms and processing embedded links may need to be adapted based on the target website.
The code doesn't cover aspects like error handling, logging, or persisting extracted data. These aspects should be incorporated in a real-world implementation.


### The following are the libraries required to run the program:
```
aiohttp
BeautifulSoup
urllib.parse
random
string
re
```
To install these libraries, you can use the following commands in your terminal:
```
pip install aiohttp
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install urllib3
pip install random
pip install string
pip install re
```

### Note: If you are using Windows, you will need to install the  library in addition to the libraries listed above. You can install it using the following command: requests
```
pip install requests
```

## Calling the Previous Program in Another Program

To call the previous program in another program, you first need to import the previous program into the new program. You can do this using the  statement. For example, if the name of the previous program is , you can import it into the new program using the following 

```
import Web_Crawler
```

Once the previous program is imported, you can call its functions. For example, if you want to call the  function, you can do so using the following crawl_website()

```
links = Web_Crawler.crawl_website("https://example.com")
```
This code will extract all links from the website  and save them in a list called .https://example.com links

You can also pass parameters to the  function. For example, if you want to add a parameter named , you can do so using the following crawl_website() parameter_name
```
links = Web_Crawler.crawl_website("https://example.com", parameter_name="my_parameter")
```
This code will extract all links from the website  and add the parameter  to each of them.https://example.com my_parameter

### Example
Here is an example of how to call and use the previous program in another program:
```
import Web_Crawler
def main():
    links = Web_Crawler.crawl_website("https://example.com")
    print(links)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This program will print a list of all links from the website .https://example.com

## Notes
You can also import the previous program using the statement. For example, you can import only the function using the following  
from... import...crawl_website()

```
from Web_Crawler import crawl_website
```
