Security Vulnerability Detection Functions This project provides you with a set of ready-made functions that you can use in your own project without XSS, SQL, SSRF and CVE... which makes it easy for you to include and use them in your project. Additional functions will be developed to detect vulnerabilities so you can incorporate them into your script. Jobs that will be worked on in the future
