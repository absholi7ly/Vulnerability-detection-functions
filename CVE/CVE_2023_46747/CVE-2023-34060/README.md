# CVE-2023-34060: VMware Cloud Director

## summary                                      
CVE-2023-34060 vulnerability is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass identity verification when entering port 22 (ssh) or port 5480 (Device Management Console) in VMware Cloud Director Appliance123. This vulnerability does not exist on port 443 (VCD provider and tenant sign-in) or in new installations of VMware Cloud Director Appliance 10.52. This vulnerability only affects versions that have been upgraded to 10.5 from an older version. This vulnerability is rated as extremely serious with a CVSSv3 score of up to 9.82.

## Program Function:
Used to discover and exploit the CVE-2023-34060 vulnerability in VMware Cloud Director.

## The main functions of the program:
### Vulnerability scanning:
Receives the target IP address, SSH ports, and appliance management console (22 and 5480 by default).
Checks whether the port is open and, if it is, sends a GET request to the port.
If port 200 returns OK, it indicates that it is at risk.
### Vulnerability exploit:
Receives the username and password for SSH and the command that must be executed on the devices.
Connects to the vulnerable device via SSH using the username and password provided.
Executes the specified command and prints the result.

## The function uses the following functions to perform its tasks:
1. is_port_open: Checks whether the port is open.
2. exploit_device: Exploit the weak device.
3. requests: HTTP requests are sent.
4. paramiko: Used to open SSH connection.
5. Subprocess: Used to execute commands on the local machine.
6. socket: used to open network connections.
7. argparse: Used to analyze user access.

## Features of the program:
Supports vulnerability detection and exploitation.
It uses threads for multitasking.
SSH and appliance management console ports can be customized, as well as the username, password, and command to be executed.
Exploits the vulnerability without the consent of the owner of the device.

## How To Use 
To use the function to detect the VMware Cloud Director, follow these steps:
Download and launch the program on your device. You will need to install the required Python libraries such as requests, paramiko, subprocess, socket, argparse, and threading.
Enter the target IP address, ports, username, password, and commands as parameters for the program. You can use the -p, -u, -w, and -c options to specify these parameters. For example, you can write 
```
python exploit.py 192.168.1.100 -p 22 5480 -c hostname
```
